BayesEoR
========

A Bayesian approach to estimating the power spectrum of the Epoch of Reionization (EoR) from interferometric observations.

BayesEoR provides a means of performing a joint Bayesian analysis of models for large-spectral-scale foreground emission and a stochastic signal from redshifted 21-cm emission emitted by neutral Hydrogen during the EoR.

For a detailed description of the methodology, see `Sims et al. 2016 <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/link_gateway/2016MNRAS.462.3069S/doi:10.1093/mnras/stw1768>`_ and `Sims et al. 2019 <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/link_gateway/2019MNRAS.484.4152S/doi:10.1093/mnras/stz153>`_. For more detail on the methodology and demonstrations using simulated data, see `Sims and Pober 2019 <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/link_gateway/2019MNRAS.488.2904S/doi:10.1093/mnras/stz1888>`_ and `Burba et al. 2023 <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023MNRAS.520.4443B/abstract>`_.
