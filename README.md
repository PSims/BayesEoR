# BayesEoR
A Bayesian approach to estimating the power spectrum at the Epoch of Reionization (EoR), from interferometric observations.

BayesEoR provides a means of performing a joint Bayesian analysis of a large-spectral-scale foreground emission and a stochastic signal from redshifted 21-cm emission emitted by neutral Hydrogen during the EoR.

For a detailed description of the methodology, see:
