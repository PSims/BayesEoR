	* Fixed a stupid bug in findCB used by the Recognizers (returned
		junk when black region border was==blackThresh).  
	
	* Added an incredibly nasty hack to keep the popup window from 
	  sticking out of the screen on top.  Tips on how to do this sanely 
		urgently solicited.

dexter (0.39) 

	* Added ScriptImageGetter and Gaucho.  I should be replacing
	  some error messages to the console with graphical alerts.  Won't
		be happening unless someone bugs me, though.

	* Results are now given sorted by abscissa values.  
	* In doing this, I moved Datapoint to a class of its own and did a 
		cleanup of DExtractor:makedata_orth.  
	* This is the first public release with some support for local extraction.

dexter (0.49) 

	* Began code cleanup at a few places.  
	* The transformation now has a class of its own and can cope with 
		skewed coordinates.  
	* Some fixes to dexter_getImage to make it actually read PDFs (but 
		it's still advisable to manually convert PDFs to Postscript before 
		using Gaucho.  
	* We now do Java 1.5 type collections.

dexter (0.5)

	* Important: Applet interface changed to always use dp_save as the
		browser target.  This works much better with iframes and popup
		blockers.
	* Send and receive URLs in AppledDataDeliverer, the default scale in
		the extraction window, and the URL of the help file are now configurable 
		through applet parameters.
	* Worked in some patches contributed by EDP sciences.
	* You can now pass a SKIPSELECTION applet parameter to directly open
		the extraction window on the full input image.
