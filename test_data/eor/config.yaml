# Noise model params
# The input data are noise free, so we need to simulate and add noise to the
# data vector.  sigma sets the standard deviation of the mean-zero Gaussian
# distribution from which the noise is drawn.  The amplitude has been chosen
# such that, in the visibility domain, the signal-to-noise ratio of the
# EoR-only visibility component to the noise component is 0.5.
